    <p >In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. 
    Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially 
    successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films 
    and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned 
    to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of 
    highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. 
    Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.

        <blockquote> Presley with Juliet Prowse in G.I. Blues Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on The Frank Sinatra Timex 
        Special—ironic for both stars, given Sinatra's not-so-distant excoriation of rock and roll. Also known as Welcome Home Elvis, 
        the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an 
        unheard-of $125,000 fee for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.[176]
        G.I. Blues, the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number one album in October. His first LP of sacred material,
         His Hand in Mine, followed two months later. It reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the U.K., remarkable figures 
         for a gospel album. In February 1961, <span>Presley</span>performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, on behalf of 24 local charities. 
         During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.[177] 
         A 12-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody.[178] As described 
         by John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. 
         Presaging much of what was to come from Presley himself over the next half-decade, the album is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening 
         pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis's birthright".[179] It would be his sixth number one LP. Another benefit concert, 
         raising money for a Pearl Harbor memorial, was staged on March 25, in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven 
         years.[180]</blockquote>

        <q>Presley returned to the United States on March 2, 1960,</q> 
        and was honorably discharged three days later with the rank of sergeant.[169] The train that carried him from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and 
        Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans.[170] On the night of March 20, he entered RCA's Nashville 
        studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, "Stuck on You", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number 
        one hit.[171] Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his best-selling singles, the ballads "It's Now or Never" 
        and "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", along with the rest of Elvis Is Back! The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as 
        full of Chicago blues "menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic 
        sax work from Boots Randolph. Elvis's singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."[172] As a whole, the record "conjured up the vision 
        of a performer who could be all things", in the words of music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of
        gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".[173] 
        Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.[174][175]

    she lived with her mother.[4] When her father died in 1977, 9-year-old Lisa Marie became joint heir to his estate with her grandfather Vernon Presley and her 
    great-grandmother Minnie Mae Presley. Following the deaths of Vernon in 1979 and Minnie Mae in 1980, she became the sole heir and 
    inherited Graceland. In 1993, on her 25th birthday, she inherited the estate, which had grown to an estimated $100 million. It is

    <p><ins>Priscilla Ann Presley </ins>(née Wagner, changed by adoption to Beaulieu; born May 24, 1945) is an American actress and business
    magnate. She is the former wife of American singer Elvis Presley as well as former chairwoman of Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), the company 
     that turned Graceland into one of the top tourist attractions in the United States. In her acting career, Presley had a starring role 
     as Jane Spencer in the three successful Naked Gun films in which she co-starred with Leslie Nielsen, and played the role of Jenna Wade 
     on the long-running television series Dallas.

    <hr style="color: #0d1a00; font-size:5px;">
    <p style="background-image:url('img/jail.jpg');">Presley was born Priscilla Ann Wagner in 
        <abbr title="New York City">NYC</abbr>. Her maternal grandfather, Albert Henry Iversen, was born in 1899 in Egersund, 
    Norway.[1] He migrated to the United States, where he married Lorraine, who was of Scots-Irish and English descent.[2] Their only daughter,
     Anna Lillian Iversen, was born in March 1926.[2] Later she was called – or her name was changed to – Ann.[2] At the age of 19, she 
     gave birth to Priscilla.[2] Presley's biological father was US Navy pilot James Wagner.[2] His parents were Kathryn and Harold Wagner.[2] 
     On August 10, 1944, at the age of 23, he married Presley's mother; they had been dating for more than three years.[2] He was killed in a plane crash while 
    returning home on leave when Presley was six months old.[2][3] When she later discovered this "family secret"[4] through clues in an 
    old wooden box of family keepsakes, her mother encouraged her to keep the revelation from her half-siblings from Ann's second marriage,
    lest it "endanger our family closeness."[3]In 1948, Priscilla's mother, Ann, had met a United States Air Force officer named Paul Beaulieu, 
    from Quebec, Canada. The couple was married within a year. He took over rearing Priscilla and was the only father she would ever know (he died on January 4, 2018, as she
    announced on her social media accounts). She took his surname[5], and over the next few years, helped care for the growing family as
    his Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. She described herself during this period as "a shy, pretty, 
    little girl, unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years."[6] Presley later recalled how uneasy she 
    felt having to move so often, never knowing if she could make ever friends for life, or if she would fit in with the people she'd 
    meet at the next place.[6]

    <p style="font-size:150%;">Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years 
    old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of 
    African-American music to a wider audience. 
    </p>

    <p><bdo dir="rtl">Vernon was but seventeen when he married Gladys Love Smith, four years his elder, in 1933. Like his relatives before him, Vernon worked 
    at any odd job that came along. For a while, he and Vester, his older brother, farmed together, raising cotton, com, soybeans and a 
    few hogs. Later, he took a job with the WPA, a federal government make - work program during the Depression. Next, he drove a delivery 
    truck for McCarty's, a Tupelo wholesale grocer, delivering grocery items to stores throughout northeast Mississippi. These, then, were 
    the Presley genes, passed along from generation to generation, some of which undoubtedly were inherited by the infant born in that 
    two-room house in the hills of East Tupelo. Gladys sister Clettes married Vester, Veron's older brother. Thus, two brothers married 
    two sisters. Few know it, but in the beginning, their roles were reversed. Vester started out dating Gladys. Vernon, eighteen months 
    younger, originally dated Clettes, 'Yeah', recalls Vester, 'I dated Gladys a few times and Vernon dated Clettes. Gladys didn't like 
    my attitude much. As I have always told you, I was too wild, in those days. So, Gladys quit seeing me and we quit seeing the Smith girls 
    for awhile. Then, Vernon started dating Gladys and soon there was only one object of his affection - Gladys.</bdo>
